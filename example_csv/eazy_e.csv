93711,"It's Vinnie paz daddy! Jedi mind tricks!
My man Stoupe holdin' it down
It's the real raw shit
The hardcore shit, kna-am sayin'?
Yeah
Friday the thirteen-style slashing ya face
Bashing ya face, tell ya army, get back to their base
C'mon cousin, that's how we get down
We the only reason that you eat and breath in this town
We beatin' them down
Raise a blade, buck 50
I rap like no one out there can fuck with me
Stuck with me, we ain't leaving the game
And keep it dirty cause we never had a reason to change
We keep it the same, start a war with the glock nine
And thug like a mob, and rock mine
So let me speak the truth again
The ancient babylonian's with nubian
You need to watch what you read in your class
'Cause the devil try to have you or repeatin the pass
I'm ready to go to war for Mumia
Fuck George Bush and his war, we gawn see him
Yeah, walk with me now
Yeah, walk with me now
Tryna step into the zone with Vinnie Paz is a
understand that I ain't really fuckin around
Yea... Yea, walk with me now
Live raps crack ya jaw (Live raps crack ya jaw)
Yea, walk with me now
I came down, the shame clown, kickin' my same sound
I'ma reign now, giant fist-splitted James Brown
I'm the poet, who rhymes was quoted
Lines are loaded
Shine decoded the vote and flow and showing signs I wrote it
At a auction, B, style cost some g's
Challangers eyes makes tears like they're forced of these
Percee P, that's me I get nasty
Rock it flashy, pass me the mic at your ass, G
But I make wrecks, tape decks at my apex
Packing latex, and safe sex with chicks and stricken paychecks
Killing ya, fillin' ya with rhymes similar
To bullets in the cylinder of a dillinger spillin' ya brainfat
I'll blast ya later, you be then essays
And be there next day like JFK's assasinator
Nobody, ever win to represent us, never did
Why you had to take us, I take every cent and your hottie
Yea, walk with me now
Yea, walk with me now
Tryna step into the zone with Vinnie Paz is a
Understand that I ain't really fuckin' around
I'm like a dessert eagle when the hammer is cocked back
Anybody holdin' any money should drop that
We shot back, spit a gospel of force
And burn y'll, with my philosophical torch
We're just tryna bring the raw shit
Smoke a L, drink a forty on the block, raw shit
The hardcore shit, for ya'll the dumbed out
Standin' the back of the club and pull the gun out
Everybody run out, the sun out, it's over
I'll take it back to the past like Sankofa
Yea, it's vinnie paz baby. Stoupe the enemy of mankind
It's like a brotherhood, it's all blood
It's all love baby, it's all love
Walk with me now
Walk with me now, what's the deal baby?
Walk with me now
It's Jedi mind, steadily shine
Live from the 215, keepin' it live aight? Yeah, yeah"

Melt you down more than once or twice
Make you shake till the world aligns
See your body tremble with the blood on fire
'Cause the season in my veins will end your world
To the season of the flames you must pray and learn
Change all the things that you've ever seen
Change all vision, kill all endings

Gotta wait on the Samhain of my soul, ooh yeah

Can we keep things together now?
My mind is a broken shell and the last pieces
Are covering the bathroom...
Which way to the door.
I'm being chased by doctors.
Lucid and tranquil.
I've got my sanity.
Everything I ever was in mapped out on the whiteboard,
For everyone and anyone.
Someone please show me the door.
To sanctity my sanctuary
Is hidden deep inside from most.
And the secrets in the locket I wear,
They've been prescribed by doctors.
I need more.
Lucid and Tranquil.
I've got my sanity.
Everything I ever was is mapped out on the whiteboard,
For everyone and anyone.
Someone please show me the room.
Where I lost my innocence
Into a vacuum of paranoid secrecy.
Is everybody after me?
Someone please show me more,
Show me more..."
78014,"If this is a game, then I don't want to play.
This means too much to me and you're so far away.
But I will wait for you.
We can see this through.
Now it's up to you.
Please tell me, you feel the same way too.
A simple touch, the look in your eye,
The sound of your voice.
They do something to me I've never felt but I don't ever want to leave.
Looks like it's happened to me once again.
Things are over before they started, another goodbye,
Unless you want to, try and I'll promise you I'll try.
A warm embrace; it's been a while since I've seen your pretty face.
If you would let me,
I don't think I would ever leave this place.
Every shared night just feels so right when I wake up with you in my arms,
Staring into my eyes.
Tell me that you'll be waiting."

253399,"It's hard for me to comprehend
Holding on with broken hands
But who will understand
Wallow in the acid rain
What's in store for us today
It's never gonna feel the same
I'm waiting for an angel now
To carry me above the clouds
Cause it's a long way home for the summer
And it's a long way up without a ladder
It's a long way home
And it's a long way down
Swallowing the bitter taste
Trying to find a remedy
Before the crystal breaks
Looking at a picture show
Frame by frame you see us grow
To something you don't know
You're trying to find a reason now
Behind a face, you see a child
It's a long way home for the summer
And it's a long way up without a ladder
And it's a long way home
And it's a long way down"

96770,"Steamin' down the muddy waters
Travelin' yonder from bay to bay
I been workin' on the barge line
Fourteen years ago today
Eighteen hours hard labor by the day
Ain't much pay for a man
[Chorus:]
Haulin' coal down the down river
And he won't be comin' home for a long time
Torches burning by the riverside
Cast their shadows Grey as stone
And the cool October days replacing
Much warmer thoughts of home
I can still see grandma sittin' on the porch
Tellin' the neighbors she's got a grandson
[Chorus]
River's rising up the marker line
While the willows softly moan
Sun is rising over the starboard shore
Paving the golden road back home
I can still see the kids jumpin' rope
But there ain't much hope for a man
[Chorus]
Haulin' coal down the down river
I'll be gone a long time
Haulin' coal down the down river
I'll be gone a long while"

You say I've lost control
But you're driving down my road
With pockets full of secrets never said
I've got some things to say and I know you can relate
Kiss and tell I never tell
But I'd love to hear these words roll out your mouth
Run away with me tonight
It's getting late so sleep well angel
Because I'll be back tomorrow
We can stay up late and smoke it down
And feel the breeze beneath our feet
And chalk it up to friends with no families
We're on our own
We're okay you're okay
Just know that I am not giving up on you"

227468,"This is just a song to say
That I'm proud for what they are
And I hope my world can take me
Half that far
Way back in Mccarthy's day
My parents left the USA
Young rebellious lovers
They left behind a nation far too proud
And powerful to say
That love transcends all colors
Some black men turned against my father
Some white men turned against my mother
Each race has their place they all would say
And with a past so battle worn
And a future begging to be born
They found a life that's growing still today
And glancing through the years
And living through their fears
I hope they can accept my goals
A bit confused, a bit unclear
And all the years behind me now
Seem like a book I've read and yet somehow
I still don't understand all the words
All the black and all the white
That rest in me that make me fight
Remind me of all the knowledge left to learn
Still some black men turned against my father
Some white men turned against my mother
Each race has their place they all would say
With a past so battle worn
And a future begging to be born
They found a life that's growing still today
And glancing through the years
And living through their fears
I hope they can accept my goals
A bit confused, a bit unclear
This is just a song to say that I'm proud for what they are
And I hope my world can take me half that far"

Clouent le jour balnÃ©aire au sol.
L'homme avance parmi les dunes
Il chemine en se balanÃ§ant
Il se souvient du Music Hall
Du long couloir en entonnoir
OÃ¹ la foule se dÃ©vidait
Les robes ne tenant qu'Ã  un fil
Et le trottoir mouillÃ©, mouillÃ©.
Il avance parmi les dunes
Gomina battue par le vent
Il pense qu'il est huit heures du soir
Et qu'il circule dans le couloir
OÃ¹ les Ã©paules bruissent en glissant
La foule se place au cÅur des dunes
La mer applaudit bruyamment.
""Tu ne sais pas lui dire adieu""
Lui a-t-elle dit hier au soir
""Tu n'verras pas si je pars
Ma route ne passe pas par tes yeux
Dans ta tÃªte, c'est huit heures du soir
A jamais, ici ou ailleurs
C'est le velours du grand couloir

A cumuler de l'infortune
Un grand cafÃ© serrÃ© l'attend
PrÃ¨s des machines qui cliquÃ¨tent
En entrant, il voit la moquette
Et il voit des lumiÃ¨res d'avant.
""Tu ne sais pas leur dire adieu
Ni Ã  ces grandes lettres rouges
Ni au dÃ©sordre des entractes
Ni aux rideaux qui vont flottant
Tu te souviens du Music Hall
De rires et de gorges serrÃ©es

Bouches closes une fois l'Ã©tÃ© passÃ©

L'assiette qu'il n'y a qu'Ã  rÃ©chauffer
Et l'hier soir qui vibre encore
Des quelques vÃ©ritÃ©s brassÃ©es
Il lui pardonne sans un effort
C'Ã©tait trop vrai pour le toucher.
Ils s'embrassent, elle part travailler
Elle a le pardon du fantÃ´me
Et l'espoir indÃ©boulonnÃ©
L'amour se cabre dans le hall
OÃ¹ le souvenir l'a condamnÃ©
Avec la grande tristesse bravache
Des fins de soirÃ©es dÃ©glinguÃ©es
OÃ¹ les vÃªtements font relÃ¢che
Et le cÅur est dÃ©shabillÃ©.
Et sous les cieux gris qui s'inquiÃ¨tent
Dans les dunes ou au Casino
Parmi les machines qui hoquÃ¨tent
Il regarde, il voit des cerceaux
De feu qui brunissent la moquette
Et il voit tomber des rideaux
Des mains qui claquent dans la tempÃªte
Au dehors.
Et il voit les lettres
Rouges, et le couloir cramoisi
Et tout le possible des nuits
Qui s'affiche, rouge, en toutes lettres
Et rien de tout Ã§a n'est fini
L'amour s'y niche, inentamÃ©
Et tous les adieux s'y empÃªtrent
Comment dire adieu Ã  la vie?
