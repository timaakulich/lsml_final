259426,"When I'm away from you, boy
All I seem to do is cry
Then, when I see you, boy
My, how the time does fly
I don't know if you need and love me
The way I love and need you
I just hope that we can get together soon, real soon
When I think about you, boy
Chills run up and down my spine
If my wish'd come true, boy
I'd be with you all the time
Wrong or right, day and night I miss you
And all my heart seems to do
Is just hope that we can get together soon, real soon
Wrong or right, day and night I miss you
And all my heart seems to do
Is just hope that we can get together soon
Oh, hope that we can get together soon
Oh, just hope that we, we can get together, baby
Hope that we can get together soon
I just hope that we, we can get together, baby
Hope that we"

157247,"Last night I started out happy
Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart"
313964,"Mounted men, with axe and shield
on their ride through shallow field
See your sons oh Vanadis
Light my ways oh Manalihs
Freyas Val
Woutans half
Oaken woods as dark as night
Home of those of heathen pride
Grant me strength oh Asynja
Be my guide oh Valfreya
Freyas Val
Vingolfs's pride
Herjan
When the moon shines bright from the dark black sky
We raise our swords to thy hail
when the runes are thrown and the ravens fly
as a sign of our heathens prevail
While the morning breaks through Tenkterian wood
while the sun sets the shores aflame
There is one thing only which never dies
The honour of thy name
Foraan
By my side my brothers fall
Now on their way to Freya's hall
We are yours oh Vanadis
Guide their ways oh Manalihs
Hjer Foraan
Tenkteriar
Herjan
While twilight covers the blood red skies
While the sun sets the shores aflame
There is one thing only which never dies
The honour of thy name
When time draws near for the chosen ones
To fall on the blood stained fields
Then death will grant us a place amongst
Our fathers in the halls of bronzen shields
A burning flame as blue as ice
Now I can see it in your eyes
Be my fate oh Vanadis
Through the nights oh Manalihs"

49717,"You have no cause to doubt what you see
Close your eyes and set your feelings free
Who has the right to say that you're wrong
Open your heart and let our love grow strong
I want our love to shine down on me
Shining down from up above
You are part of me
I fix my sights and I walk without fear
The road may be dark but my direction is clear
Like a neon sign in a distant town
I watch you shine when the lights go down
I want our love to shine down on me
Shining down from up above
You are part of me
I want our love to shine
Oh I want our love to shine
People too scared to say what they mean
Gonna wash their hands to keep their conscience clean
In search of a flame that some call desire
They fly into the light and right back into the fire
I want our love to shine on me
Shining down from up above
You are part of me"
29635,"Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care who's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone"

His pops was a Nutty Blocc Compton Crip
Moms was from South Central, she claimed Hoover
They had the lil nigga in 1979 at Martin Luther King hospital
And if you know anything about Killa King, you know this:
Being born there is just like dying there"
96790,"Darlin' there's a thing or two
I want to take the time to say
Every moment here with you
Puts heaven in my day
I'm mystified by the smile that blossoms on your face
And the magic seems to lift me to a cloud where we embrace
I don't have to dream no more, no
Now I believe in miracles
Your love turned my world around
Heaven bound
Heaven bound
Heaven bound
Heaven bound
Oh, I simply must confess
I'm glad to be a girl
you've got to be an angel
'Cause you put heaven in my world
Your shadow is my tropic sun
And it's summer all year long
Your presence is my paradise
How could anything go wrong
Now I'm absolutely sure
That you're all I've been living for, yeah
Your love turned my world around
Heaven bound
Heaven
I'm in, I'm in heaven
I'm in, I'm in heaven
I'm in, I'm in heaven
Every time I'm near you my heart just won't keep still
The closer that I get to you, the better that I feel
I don't have to dream no more, no, no
Now you're all I'm living for, yeah
Cause your love turned my world around
Heaven bound"
200344,"The world is so dramatic
I can't believe
That we're still livin'
Oh in this crazy crazy world
That I'm still livin'
With all the problems of the day
How can we go on
So tired of hearing people say how can we go on
Fantasy people
Make believe people
How can you go on
But you're still livin'
Race relations, segregation, no occupation
World inflation, demonstration, miseducation
No celebration to celebrate your lives
Listen people listen
Lift up your hearts to God
Lift up your soul
Teach your children wisdom
Reality today so they can live tomorrow
I can't believe
That we're still livin'
Oh in this crazy crazy world
That I'm still livin'
With all the problems of the day
How can we go on
So tired of hearing people say
How can I go on
Fantasy people
Make believe people
How can you go on
But you're still livin'
Listen people listen
Lift up your hearts to God
Teach your children wisdom
Reality today"
273906,"Hollow
Faces staring through my window
Sometimes
I can play a boy you might know
Station
Standing cold and old I'm insane
Gender
Is uncertain just like my name
The lemon kid is my friend
But even he don't know me well
Oh that's too bad
The waiter is an old man
Who looks at me so sly and strange
What's on his mind
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you
Queenie
From a doorway says ""You got time?""
Panic
Not tonight if you don't mind
Oh no
My fear of streets I cover
Today
My room is home for hours
You can stay if you know your lines
But please take care
I'll suck your mind dry
You'll never guess
And you can never know me
I'll change if I begin to feel
What's your name
Zero hero says I'm no-one
He could be right but who's to know
Man from the sky
Oh well I'm growing tired of this place
I think it's time to change my face
You can't even try
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you"
198492,"Sweet simple song of different lights and different shades
The sound of life erupts and fades and all the world must play along
My life has been a song
Here as I sleep, the love I dream will gently creep
Inside my heart I softly keep the tune that plays too long
My life has been a song
Every sound in my head, every word that I said is like a melody melody
That no little person like me could ever change
Every sound in the street, all the cold and the heat
Is like a symphony symphony
Which has never before been rearranged
Sweet simple song of different lights and different shades
The sound of life erupts and fades and all the world must play along
My life has been a song
Every sound in my head, every word that I said is like a melody melody
That no little person like me could ever change
Every sound in the street, all the cold and the heat
Is like a symphony symphony
Which has never before been rearranged
Sweet simple song of different lights and different shades
The sound of life erupts and fades and all the world must play along
My life has been a song
Every sound in my head, every word that I said is like a melody melody
That no little person like me could ever change

92525,"You lover leaver
You can haunt the kids you'll bring
Golden retriever
You wear a cross around your neck
Hiding all alone in your old home
We can go into the bed if you want
Set the wheel in motion
Let it roll right off you desk
Fixated notion
When your gone there's nothing left
Hiding all alone in your old home
We can go into the bed if you want
Honey there's a time and place for us
I'll be standing in line
People always laugh but I don't even give a fuck
You nearly killed my spirit
When I heard about your death
And I don't wanna hear it
It gets cold I feel your breath
Hiding all alone in your old home
We can go into the bed if you want
Honey there's a time and place for us
But all you do is cry
Cause you're stuck inside a grey
Baby there just ain't enough"
32512,"I see everybody around but it feels like we're in private
I know you want me so bad cause you just can't seem to hide it
The lights are moving to the rhythm of the music,
When we're together,
Everything just comes together, baby
So inspired by the movement,
We can lose it, I hope you're ready
As long as I see the strobe lights,
I'm dancing all night long
When we're together, baby,
I'm feeling all right,
You got me all night long
So tell the DJ play it all night long,
All night long, all night, night, night
So tell the DJ play it all night long,
All night long, all night, night night
So tell the DJ play it
Tonight the admission is free,
Now we're shutting the club down
We moving now to the streets,
All we got left is love now
Feel my troubles fading to the rhythm of your heart beat,
When we're together,
Everything just comes together baby
Every motion calls your name,
Baby once you start me
And I hope you're ready
So tell the DJ play it,
All my worries help me put the past behind
All around us this worlds in a hurry
While we stand still in time
Feels like we're moving to the rhythm of the music,
When we're together
Everything just comes together, baby
So inspired by the movement
We can't lose it
And I hope you're ready
So tell the DJ play it,
It's only you and me together
And this feelings so strong,
Wish it could stay like this forever
All night long, all night long
Said all night long."

121479,"Well, he walks in the room, says
Youre looking so lovely, dear
Its been a long time
What are you doing here
I dont think Ive ever seen you looking so well
So she says
Thanks for the compliment.
Tell me old friend-
Tell me, where have you been.
I dont think Ive ever been so happy to see
Another face before
Oh, I said
Id never walk that road again
Oh, I believe
Never just came and went
Oh, I want this to be
Fairytale happenstance
Do you believe
That the past should remain the past
And do you agree
In living on with our regrets
Or do you think that some things are just meant to be
So she says,
Please dont you get me wrong
But I dont believe
In fairytales after all
But if youre asking for one dance, I think
Ill grant you one last request
Oh, I said
Id never walk that road again
Oh, I believe
Never just came and went
Oh, I want this to be
Fairytale happenstance
He says, Can you here me now
Do you agree
Theres something between us
And do you believe
In being with the one you love
Or do you think
Enough is enough
She says, Come a little closer over here
And Ill tell how I feel about it
I remember days of
Laughing and innocence
But what I believe in
Is our current circumstance
But if you want this
To become one more chance
Well, this aint some kind of
Fairytale happenstance
So she says, Dear friend
Please dont you get me wrong
But I dont believe in
Fairytales after all"
324263,"I am sending you flowers which i picked up on the road
I am sending them to you between my dreams
Because i cant speak with you
And i am sending you kisses in my songs
And during the nights when i sleep
Our hearts are coming together.
You leave again
And if there is a full moon by night
If i feel cold in the morning
Your memory warms me
And your smile when you wake up.
My beautiful baby i swear to you
That every day i see you closer.
And while sleeping between my dreams
I am trying to speak with you and feel you closer to me.
I want to have you in my arms,
To be able to come out and hug you and never again let you go.
(Chorus)
I want to find you in my dreams
To wake up with your kisses
There is no place too far away for the two of us to meet
Let me give you my hand
To have you by my side
My baby i promise you i will always be your love
Please dont go away.
I am sending you flowers which i picked up on the road
I am sending them to you between my dreams
Because i cant speak with you
And i am preparing ten thousand word
And I go prepareing ten thousand words
To convince you that by my side
Everything will be like we dreamed it.
And while sleeping between my dreams
I am trying to speak with you and feel you closer to me.
I want to have you in my arms
To be able to come out and hug you and never again let you go.
(Chorus)
I want to find you in my dreams
To wake up with your kisses
There is no place too far away for the two of us to meet
Let me give you my hand
To have you by my side
My baby i promise you i will always be your love
Please dont go away.
I am sending you flowers to decorate your house
May the reddest always be at the entrance
That every morning they will not be short of water
Get up very early to water them
You can name each one of them
So that they will always listen to your call
Beautiful little thing that could be the most prized one
The daisy that is called Mariana
I am sending you flowers to decorate your house
May the reddest always be at the entrance
That every morning they will not be short of water
Get up very early to water them
You can name each one of them
So that they will always listen to your call
Beautiful little thing that could be the most prized one
The daisy that is called Mariana
I am sending you flowers to decorate your house
May the reddest always be at the entrance
That every morning they will not be short of water
Get up very early to water them
You can name each one of them
So that they will always listen to your call
Beautiful little thing that could be the most prized one
The daisy that is called Mariana"
176918,"Like an animal
Senses fear
Chills up my spine
I know you're here
It's been so long
So what did you expect?
I know where you've been
And I disrespect
I feel sickened
I choke and spit up words
They all mean nothing
It's all absurd
Your body has been used up
Your mind has changed direction
I can't believe I touched you
I can't believe it
Inside I wish it wasn't true
It makes it hard to look at you
Ugly I feel
My body's inside you
Tongue in, tongue out
I can taste him on you
You're naked as a child
Your innocence is gone
Given away for nothing
And I hate what's left
Inside I wish it wasn't true
It makes it hard to look at you
I close my eyes; I close my mind
But it makes nothing go away
Look back in anger
Look back in pain
Look back in disrespect
It's you I can't respect
I look back in anger
And it's so hard to look back
I close my eyes; I close my mind
But it makes nothing go away"
355484,"Alguma coisa acontece no meu coraÃ§Ã£o
Que sÃ³ quando cruza a Ipiranga e Av. SÃ£o JoÃ£o
Ã que quando eu cheguei por aqui eu nada entendi
Da dura poesia concreta de tuas esquinas
Da deselegÃ¢ncia discreta de tuas meninas
Ainda nÃ£o havia para mim Rita Lee
A tua mais completa traduÃ§Ã£o
Alguma coisa acontece no meu coraÃ§Ã£o
Que sÃ³ quando cruza a Ipiranga e avenida SÃ£o JoÃ£o
Quando eu te encarei frente a frente e nÃ£o vi o meu rosto
Chamei de mau gosto o que vi, de mau gosto, mau gosto
Ã que Narciso acha feio o que nÃ£o Ã© espelho
E Ã  mente apavora o que ainda nÃ£o Ã© mesmo velho
Nada do que nÃ£o era antes quando nÃ£o somos mutantes
E foste um difÃ­cil comeÃ§o
Afasto o que nÃ£o conheÃ§o
E quem vem de outro sonho feliz de cidade
Aprende depressa a chamar-te de realidade
Porque Ã©s o avesso do avesso do avesso do avesso
Do povo oprimido nas filas, nas vilas, favelas
Da forÃ§a da grana que ergue e destrÃ³i coisas belas
Da feia fumaÃ§a que sobe, apagando as estrelas
Eu vejo surgir teus poetas de campos, espaÃ§os
Tuas oficinas de florestas, teus deuses da chuva
Pan-AmÃ©ricas de Ãfricas utÃ³picas, tÃºmulo do samba
Mas possÃ­vel novo quilombo de Zumbi
E os Novos Baianos passeiam na tua garoa
E novos baianos te podem curtir numa boa"
